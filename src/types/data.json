            "title": "Consume less energy",
            "details": "Using less energy lowers your carbon footprint by reducing the need for electricity and fuels, which are often produced from carbon-heavy sources. This cuts down greenhouse gas emissions, aiding climate change mitigation."

            "id": 2,
            "title": "Don't use the car",
            "details": "Not using a car reduces your carbon footprint by cutting down on the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. It also decreases the demand for fuel production, which has its own carbon costs, and reduces traffic congestion, leading to fewer emissions overall."

            "title": "Recycle cardboard",
            "details": "Recycling cardboard contributes to your carbon footprint because the collection, transportation, and processing of cardboard require energy, often from fossil fuels. However, it is still more eco-friendly than producing new cardboard from raw materials, as it reduces deforestation and the energy needed for production."
